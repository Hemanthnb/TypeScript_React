# React + TypeScript Project

This project is a simple React application built with TypeScript.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Utilizes TypeScript for static type checking, providing enhanced code quality and developer experience.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Follows a component-based architecture, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.
- **State Management**: Uses React hooks for state management, ensuring efficient and predictable state updates.
- **Routing**: Implements client-side routing using React Router for navigating between different views.
- **API Integration**: Demonstrates integration with external APIs using fetch or Axios for data fetching.
- **Form Handling**: Illustrates form handling with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and validation.
